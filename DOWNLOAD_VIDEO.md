   - Rename it to `hero-bg.mp4` (if needed)

   Your folder structure should look like:

   ```

4. **Refresh your browser**
   - The video should now display as the hero background
   - It will autoplay and loop

## If video doesn't appear:

- Check the browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify the file is named `hero-bg.mp4`
- Make sure the `videos/` folder is in the root directory
- Try a hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

That's it! Your ocean-themed site with the custom video background is ready to go.
